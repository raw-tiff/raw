# raw

This is not a production ready raw reader, just a personal project I started while studying digital image processing. If you need a complete, fully functional library, check [dcraw](https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/) out.

Currently the only format supported is uncompressed, linear (demosaiced) Adobe DNG. Reading TIFF metadata is also supported.

I decided to support DNG first because, unlike proprietary formats such as Canon's CR2 or Nikon's .NEF, DNG is open and has its specification publicly available. Also, virtually all widely used raw formats are TIFF-based, like DNG, so if you can read it, you are more than halfway done reading any raw file format.

You can use [Adobe Camera Raw and DNG Converter](https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=106&platform=Windows) to convert your raw files to DNG.

I am looking for contributors willing to help me implement support for reading nonlinear compressed data. While uncompressed linear is specific to DNG, nonlinear compressed is the same format used by Canon and Nikon.

## Before you begin

Keep in mind TIFF is a decades old file format that has been receiving extensions for as long as has existed. It's full of idiosyncrasies and I strongly encourage you to read the following specifications before proceeding:

* TIFF Revision 6.0 Final - June 3, 1992
* TIFF Technical Note 1: TIFF Trees
* ISO 12234-2:2001, Electronic still-picture imaging – Removable memory – Part 2: TIFF/EP image data format
* [Digital Negative Specification Version 1.4.0.0](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/products/photoshop/pdfs/dng_spec_1.4.0.0.pdf)

## Supported color spaces

* [CIE 1931 XYZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space)
* [CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV)
* [CIE LCHuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV#Cylindrical_representation_(CIELCH))
* [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB)
* LSH (CIE LCHuv, with chroma C replaced with saturation S = C/L)

## The Code

	com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessorEngine
		uses com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessor
			implemented by com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.AbstractTiffProcessor
				extended by com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.DngProcessor
					extended by com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.CommandLineInvoker
						uses com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.Editor

### com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessorEngine

Bridges the gap between (1) reading a TIFF file (see `com.github.gasrios.raw.data.ImageFileDirectoryLoader` and `com.github.gasrios.raw.io.TiffInputStream`) and making its information available in an easy to use fashion (see `com.github.gasrios.raw.data.ImageFileDirectory`) and (2) writing code that actually processes this information.

### com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessor

This interface provides consumer methods called by TiffProcessorEngine when content is available and ready to be processed. By implementing this interface you can manipulate TIFF images as you see fit.

### com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.AbstractTiffProcessor

Provides empty implementations of `com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessor` methods you do not care about, so you can only focus on the stuff you need.

### com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.DngProcessor

This class makes all transformations deemed too complex to be at `com.github.gasrios.raw.data.ImageFileDirectoryLoader` when processing the high resolution image IFD:

1. Reads image strips and converts them to a width X height pixel matrix;
2. Converts camera coordinates to XYZ D50 values;

This pretty much ends all the dirty work needed to read the TIFF file, and makes its information available to people whose business is doing actual photo editing.

### com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.CommandLineEditorInvoker

`com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.DngProcessor` subclass that provides an easy to use command line caller for image editors.

Usage: `java com.github.gasrios.raw.CommandLineEditorInvoker <AnEditor implements com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.Editor> image.dng`

### com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.Editor

A simple interface called from `com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.CommandLineEditorInvoker`. The point is to make image editing as simple as possible.

### com.github.gasrios.raw.editor.Library

Utility methods to save, display and manipulate images.
