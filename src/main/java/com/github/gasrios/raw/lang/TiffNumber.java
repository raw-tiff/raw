 * See "TIFF Revision 6.0 Final - June 3, 1992", page 15.
 *
 * Two TIFF numeric types do not map on any of Java's primitive numeric types:
 *
 * - RATIONAL: two 4-byte unsigned integers, numerator and denominator of a fraction.
 * - SRATIONAL: two 4-byte signed (twos-complement) integers, numerator and denominator of a fraction.
 *
 * This happens because Java has no fixed point arithmetic. Preserving RATIONAL and SRATIONAL values for as long as we can helps
 * with precision issues that conversions to double might introduce. For this reason we create this class and its two subclasses,
 * com.github.gasrios.raw.lang.RATIONAL and com.github.gasrios.raw.lang.SRATIONAL.
