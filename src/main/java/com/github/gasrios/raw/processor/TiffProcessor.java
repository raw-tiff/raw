/*
 * This interface provides consumer methods called by com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.TiffProcessorEngine when content is available and
 * ready to be processed. By implementing this interface you can manipulate TIFF images as you see fit.
 *
 * Class com.github.gasrios.raw.processor.AbstractTiffProcessor provides empty implementations of methods you do not care about for
 * convenience.
 *
 * Sometimes different methods may be called for the same IFD; for example if the first IFD has a thumbnail - which it should
 * - the following methods will all be called, in this order:
 *
 * - processThumbnailIfd()
 * - processFirstIfd()
 * - processPreviewIfd()
 * - processIfd()
 *
 * Same applies to the high resolution and EXIF IFDs. We also provide "end()" methods called after processing an IFD.
 *
 * Calling order obeys the logic "more generic last", although this is a rather loose definition. In the case above we assume
 * "processPreviewIfd" to be more generic than "processFirstIfd" because a file may have several previews but only one first
 * IFD. On the other hand "processFirstIfd" is considered more generic than "processThumbnailIfd" because a thumbnail is also
 * a first IFD but the contrary is not true.
 *
 * Calling order of "end()" methods follows the opposite rule "more generic first" to provide proper nesting.
